# TensorFlow Certification Prep 🚀
This repo contains the Jupyter notebooks I created while working through [ZTM's TensorFlow course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/). The goal of this course is to help prepare me to pass the TensorFlow Developer Exam 📚 and earn the certification.

## Notebooks 📔
Each notebook corresponds to a section or module from the course curriculum. They include my work, code examples, and exercises from following along with the lectures and materials.

### Module 1 - Deep Learning and TensorFlow Fundamentals 🧠
 - Notebook 1 - 00_tf_fundamentals.ipynb
### Module 2 - Regression 📈
 - Notebook 2, 3 - 01_neural_network_regression.ipynb, neural_network_regression_worked_example.ipynb
### Module 3 - Classification 📊
- Notebook 4, 5 - 02_neural_network_classification.ipynb, neural_network_classification_worked_example.ipynb
### Module 4 - Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks 🖼️
 - Notebook 6, 7 - 03_CV.ipynb, cnn_worked_example.ipynb
### Module 5 - Transfer Learning Part 1: Feature Extraction 🔄
- Notebook 8 - 04_transfer_learning_part_1
### Module 6 - Transfer Learning Part 2: Fine Tuning 🛠️
- Notebook 9 - 05_transfer_learning_part_2 **in progress** 🚧

## Resources 📚
Some additional resources I've found helpful:

- [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide)
- [ZTM Book Version](https://dev.mrdbourke.com/tensorflow-deep-learning/)
- [Hands-On Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=hands+on+machine+learning+with+scikit-learn+and+tensorflow+3&sr=8-5)

## Status 📅
I'm currently working through Module 6 of the course. My goal is to complete all notebooks and reviews in preparation for taking the exam by mid-October, 2023. I will add links to the notebooks for easy navigation. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome!👍
